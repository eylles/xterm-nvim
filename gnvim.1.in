.TH GNVIM 1 gnvim\-@VERSION@
.SH NAME
gnvim \- nvim terminal wrapper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnvim
.RB [ options ]
.IR file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The program gnvim is a wrapper script to allow gvim like functionality for neovim along a terminal
emulator, ie: when launched with or without files it will search for an instance of 'gnvim' by
checking on the runfile, the runfile is typically located at
.B /var/run/user/${UID}/${class}/${class}.lock
after which gnvim either creates a new terminal window via the
.B x-terminal-emulator
command or simply hands out the file to the running instance that posses a terminal

The actual handling of the file and arguments is done by an instance of neovim, either by itself
listening to the p_file located at:
.B /var/run/user/${UID}/${class}/${class}.pipe
OR an instance of neovim running inside a tmux session started by
.B tmux-nvim
(1)

The default terminal emulator to handle the terminal window is the
.B x-terminal-emulator
interface, a debianism that may be a wrapper or a symlink to a terminal emulator binary, this is
because for the intended functionality of this script the terminal emulator should be compatible
with the following xterm(1) options: -title, -name, -e

Proper handling of the options and a compatible behaviour is expected however not all terminal are
compatible out of the box, debian does by policy provide wrappers which then get symlinked onto the
x-terminal-emulator, an example would be the gnome-terminal.wrapper from:
.IR https://sources.debian.org/src/gnome-terminal/3.56.2-2/debian/gnome-terminal.wrapper

To consult which terminal emulators in debian currently provide the x-terminal-emulator interface
either by natively supporting the xterm options or through a wrapper check in:
.IR https://packages.debian.org/sid/x-terminal-emulator

If your preferred terminal emulator does not appear in the list you can provide your own wrapper
script and either link it into x-terminal-emulator or simply specify that script as the terminal
command to call inside the configuration file.

.SH OPTIONS

.SH CONFIGURATION
.P
The configuration of gnvim is located at:
.B ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}/gnvim/configrc

.P
To see the location of the configuration file and generating it if running for the first time, run
gnvim with the help flag

.P
The configuration defines the following options:

.TP
.B
term_cmd
the terminal command to use, should be able to support xterm's "-name", "-title" and "-e" options,
by default the debianism
.B x-terminal-emulator
is used to ensure support of these options within debian and derivates.

.TP

nv_cmd
the neovim command to use, by default
.B /usr/bin/nvim
is used, but can be set to any custom wrapper command the user chooses.

.TP
.B
class
the class for the gnvim instance, the
.B gnvim
class is used by default.

.TP
.B
no_tmux
