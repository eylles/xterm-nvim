.SH NAME
xterm-nvim \- neovim terminal wrappers
.SH DESCRIPTION
You are reading the manual page for the
.B xterm-nvim
package, this package is a set of scripts that provide the functionality of "gnvim", ie a
"non terminal" interface of neovim, that more cleanly integrates with a Desktop Environment than the
terminal emulator neovim does, this package aims to correctly provide said integration for those
that do prefer to use neovim inside a terminal emulator and are not fond nor prefer any of the
existing neovim GUIs to the terminal experience but DO want the integration onto their Graphical
User Interface for a more ergonomic User Experience.
