.TH VIM-ANYWHERE 1 vim-anywhere\-@VERSION@
.SH NAME
vim-anywhere \- nvim anywhere
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vim-anywhere
.RB [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
A re-implementation of the vim-anywhere script from
.IR https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere

This script aims to not just do some modernization to the vim-anywhere script but also to take the
concept and make it compatible with the gnvim implementation from this package and provide some
features that were suggested and pull requests even created but never adopted by the classic
vim-anywhere, for example populating the tmp file with the contents of the clipboard, being able to
change the location for the TMP_DIR, changing the type of the text file from plain text to something
else via an extension string in the config, supporting wayland environments, start in insert mode,
configurable delays for focus and per character typing, class name.

Unlike the original vim-anywhere no assumptions about the user's environment are made beyond the use
of neovim, therefore adding this program to be launched by a keybind is left completely onto the
user to decide.

The configuration defines the following options:

.TP
.B
behaviour
vim anywhere behaviour, it can be classic or simple

classic: the behaviour of the classic vim anywhere script, a tmp dir is created and every instance
         of vim-anywhere creates a new file inside that directory.

simple:  a simpler behaviour, the tmp dir is created and every time an instance of vim-anywhere runs
         a tmp file with a static name is created, once vim exits the tmp file is deleted.

.TP
.B
TMP_DIR
the location for the tmp dir, by default the tmp dir is created at:
.B /tmp/vim-anywhere
with a simple mkdir, that is, expecting the dir can just be created there without issue.

.TP
.B
DEF_FT
default file type extension, no checking is done for this whatsoever, just pass your preferred file
type extension for creating of the file, by default that is "txt" to create plain text files, but
you may change it to whatever you want, like "md" for markdown or "py" for python, "c" for c,
you get the idea, it may be useful for you to have support for some specific syntax.

.TP
.B
class
the class option for vim-anywhere, this is passed on to gnvim(1) which will set the terminal command
class and title to this very same string, this should make it possible to add special rules for your
window manager, given it has such functionality, to make the vim-anywhere terminal window into an
"ontop" window with your desired dimensions and any other setting your window manager and compositor
are able to apply based on the name title of the window alone.

.TP
.B
insertmode_start
this option controls werether or not to initiate the neovim instance of vim-anywhere in insert mode,
leave this option empty to start in normal mode, write any text inside this to start in insert mode,
whichever text is written is of no relevance as all that is checked is werether the variable is
empty or not.
