nvim-url-handler \- nvim file uri scheme handler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nvim-url-handler
.RB [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is a handler for the file open schema commonly used GUI and web programs to open files
inside text editors via the "Open in Editor" action, this program is not intended to be ran directly
by the user but rather indirectly through a browser or another program that can invoke calls to the
x-schema-handler URL for a text editor to open a file in, uri schemas like the following are
supported by this utility:

    nvim://open?file=/path/to/file&line=123
    nvim://open?url=file:///path/to/file&line=123
    nvim://open?uri=file:///path/to/file&line=123

    nvim://open/?file=/path/to/file&line=123
    nvim://open/?url=file:///path/to/file&line=123
    nvim://open/?uri=file:///path/to/file&line=123


.P
The installed .desktop file is built to handle the following schemas:
@SCHEMES@

Notice however that those are only the schema identifiers the .desktop file is invoking
nvim-url-handler for, internally nvim-url-handler does not care what the identifier name before the
.B ://open
string may be, as it simply uses a glob to match any substring preceding the string, empty string
included.

.P
As far as upstream neovim is concerned this feature is an add-on that may or may not be implemented
through the nvim built in uri decoder, to follow the upstream status of url schema handler check:
